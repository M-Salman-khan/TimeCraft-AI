# TimeCraft AI âœ¨

**Turning timetable chaos into clarity.**

## Project Overview

TimeCraft AI is an innovative web application designed to help colleges and teacher-education institutes in India automatically generate conflict-free, optimized academic timetables, fully aligned with the NEP-2020 framework.

Our goal is to save hours of manual scheduling, ensure fair faculty load, and give students a seamless academic journey. The app is designed to feel warm, professional, and supportive â€” never bureaucratic.
